# Contributing to musaeum

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

## Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

### How to make a pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints. Follow pep8.
4. Issue that pull request!

Use a Consistent Coding Style

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same GPL License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
Report bugs using Github's issues

### We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Bug Reports should have:

1. A quick summary and/or background.
2. Steps to reproduce. Be specific!.
3. What you expected would happen.
4. What actually happens.
5. Notes (why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).
